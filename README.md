# About

This repo contains the provisioning information for setting up a dev environment for building a local copy of [drupal-site-jnl-elife](https://github.com/elifesciences/drupal-site-jnl-elife).

It is being built on top of the [drupal - vagrant project](https://drupal.org/project/vagrant), with the configuration moved to v2 of the vagrant API, and using librarian and chef for managing cookbooks.

# Preqrequisites:

Git on local host
Git user created and with access to the elifesciences repository
VirtualBox v4.2 installed (needed for shared folders)
Vagrant installed on local host
Tunnelblick installed on the host

# Setup

To setup your system to work with Vagrant and Chef please follow the guide provided at [elife-template-env](https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-template-env).

You are advised to setup and use the elife specified base box described in that guide, as it contains a base box configured with the required versions of chef, php and vagrant. If you don't have it setup already, you can add this box with the command:

	vagrant box add pre64-elife-rb1.9-chef-11 http://cdn.elifesciences.org/vm/pre64-elife-rb1.9-chef-11.box

Set up Tunnelblick to connect to Highwire using the key provided, and then connect.

# Quickstart

Currently, use branch ruth-vagrant-fixes for the elife-vagrant module.

	git clone git@github.com:elifesciences/elife-vagrant.git
	
	### change elifesciences to highwire in the next line if you have access and want the official repo: ###
	git clone git@github.com:elifesciences/drupal-highwire.git
	
	git clone git@github.com:elifesciences/drupal-site-jnl-elife.git
	cd elife-vagrant

Now, Locate a copy of the journal database dump and save as a gzipped compressed file to .../elife-vagrant/public/jnl-elife.sql.gz, and locate a copy of the settings.php file (with drupal passwords and database setup) and save in .../elife-vagrant/public/settings.php

	librarian-chef install && vagrant up
	
	## not necessary, but to check the server out, do:
	vagrant ssh

The site is set up to accept connections using http://elife.vbox.local:8080// so on the host configure /etc/hosts to include/extend a line such as:

	127.0.0.1    localhost  elife.vbox.local


# Restarting

Some changes can be made using 'vagrant provision', but it is not recommended because changes aren't necessarily noticed and redone correctly:

	vagrant provision

To remake, following a change in the config files, do:

	cd elife-vagrant      # in this directory
	rm -rf cookbooks  tmp  Cheffile.lock
	librarian-chef install && vagrant up



# What it does

Cookbooks are installed using librarian. Check the `Cheffile` to see which cookbooks we donwnlad as community cookbooks, and which ones we have made private instances of. (Creating a private instance of a cookbook is an anti-pattern, however for our immediate purposes, this is OK).

Librarian also installs the git repo for the elife specific drupal modules and themes. 

This git repo includes the `roles` provided by the drupal vagrant proejct. These have been modified to not install varnish or memcached. This was done out of convinience. 

This git repo contains a placeholder `public` directory. This is the directory that is used to serve our drupal site out of.

## Issues with the Drupal Install

## TODO

- the roles are a little over complicated, these should be simplified

- `cookbooks/drupal/recipes/drupal_apps.rb` has been modified to not check whether the key `#if node["hosts"].has_key("localhost_aliases")` exists. Probably an updated issues with Ruby, should check, and re-implement

- apc has been turned off, as getting it to install via chef was beyond me.

- contribute back fixes to the main vagrant-drupal project, and stop holiding a private version of these cookbooks.
